# LookUp
###  This is my contribution to the topic **Data Visualisation**, second project in the class *Steel Ant - Eingabe Ausgabe* taught by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas, University of applied science - Potsdam (Germany).

Microsite: http://martakarta.github.io/LookUp

### The ISS
Goal of the project was to create a Data Visualisation based on the geographical position of the International Spase Station, available on https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings.

### Concept
The inspiration for this visualisation was the thought, that the ISS is actually visible naked eyes from the earth. For doing that is thou necessary to know when to look up. The json data in this repository delivers the all the visible moments of the ISS in December 2015 from the main cities of Germany.

*Red = moments of visibility; White = German cities*

The sourse code filters this information and shows which day and at what time the ISS is visible in the chosen german city.

### Berlin
As an example the visualisation of the moments of visibility in Berlin. The axis x rappresent the december days and the axis y the hours in a day.
